## Polish and Reliability Request (2025-12-17)
"im going up, so don't stop for anything, keep goign until you have something working. test HELLA and then send to github. i basically want an assurance that it'll work the first time. it should load, have the wizzard, and have me able to sign in and out, with the standard things like internet, loading programs, and similar things. try doing the AI, but i care more about having something working rather than the AI for tmrw. make it aesthetic. MAKE IT SUPER EASY TO EDIT. have EXCELLENT documentation in the read me and commits. comit frequently, and if something goes catastrofically wrong, re run to there."
