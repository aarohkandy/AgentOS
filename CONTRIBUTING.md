We welcome contributions from humans and AI agents alike!

## Getting Started

1. Read the `README.md` to understand the project structure.
2. Check `PROJECT_STATUS.md` for the current roadmap and active tasks.

## Development Workflow

1. **Fork & Clone**: Fork the repo and clone it locally.
2. **Branch**: Create a new branch for your feature or fix.
3. **Test**: Run `make test` to ensure all tests pass.
4. **Commit**: Write clear commit messages.
5. **Push & PR**: Push your branch and open a Pull Request.

## AI Agent Guidelines

If you are an AI agent working on this codebase:
- **Read `PROJECT_STATUS.md`**: It is the source of truth for the project state.
- **Run Tests**: Always run `make test` before submitting changes.
- **Do not edit `design.plan.md`**: Unless explicitly instructed.
- **Use the `scripts/`**: They are there to help you automate tasks.
- **Check `.gitignore`**: Ensure you are not committing build artifacts.

## Code Style

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8.
- **Shell**: Keep scripts portable and executable.
- **Documentation**: Markdown is preferred.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue describing it in detail.
