# ANOS Visual Assets

This directory contains placeholder assets for ANOS branding. Replace these with your actual ANOS symbol and branding when ready.

## Files to Replace

- `logo.png` - ANOS logo (will be used in installer, boot screen, desktop)
- `splash.png` - Boot splash screen
- `wallpaper.png` - Default desktop wallpaper
- `theme/` - KDE theme files
- `icons/` - Icon theme (with ANOS symbol)

## Current Status

All files are placeholders. The system will work with these, but you should replace them with your actual ANOS branding assets.
